# TG-Google-Bing-ImageSearch


Python script that implements image search functionality using the Bing and Google search sugoi-APIs. It provides two commands: '/bingimg' and '/googleimg'. When the '/bingimg' command is executed, it searches for images related to a given query using the Bing search API. Similarly, the '/googleimg' command searches for images using the Google search API. The code retrieves image URLs from the API response, creates a media group of photos, and sends it as a reply to the user.
